# 3 LBS BattleBot

Along with another brother of my fraternity, Caleb French, we are currently looking at the possibility of building a battlebot to compete in the 3 lbs weight class at an NHRL battlebots competition.

We are interested in choosing a more complicated design similar to another bot named Droopy. Droopy interests us because it is a precession walker, using the differential precession between its two flywheels to move.

We are started the design and math for this design, but are currently pondering various ways to alter the design, both to improve and put our own spin on this design. One idea I am currently working out it potentially incorperating an aspect of a gryowalker(pictured below) by attaching the motor and weapon to a servo to adjust the amount and angle of the axis of rotation, therefore changing the force of gyroscopic precession.
